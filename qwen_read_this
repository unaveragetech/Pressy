No, **this file is not malicious** — it is a legitimate, well-structured Python application called **Pressy**, designed to compress MP4 videos to meet Discord’s 10MB upload limit using FFmpeg.

---

### ✅ **Why This File Is Safe**

#### 1. **Transparent Purpose**
- The script’s goal is clear: **compress videos** for Discord.
- It uses **FFmpeg** (a widely trusted, open-source multimedia tool) to do the actual encoding.
- All functionality is documented in comments and docstrings.

#### 2. **No Obfuscated or Suspicious Code**
- No encryption, obfuscation, shellcode, or hidden payloads.
- No network calls to external servers (except possibly via `subprocess` calling `ffmpeg`, which is local).
- No use of dangerous modules like `os.system()`, `exec()`, `eval()`, or `ctypes` for malicious purposes.

#### 3. **Bundled FFmpeg Is Normal & Legitimate**
- The script includes a bundled copy of **ffmpeg-8.0-essentials_build**, which is:
  - From [Gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) — a **trusted source** for FFmpeg builds.
  - Common practice in desktop apps to bundle dependencies so users don’t need to install them manually.
- The script **only adds the bundled FFmpeg to the user's PATH** if it’s not already present — and only with user consent (via popup).

#### 4. **PATH Modification Is User-Initiated & Reversible**
- The script modifies **only the *user* environment variable `PATH`**, not system-wide.
- It does **not** modify registry keys outside `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment`.
- It provides an **uninstaller function** (`uninstall_ffmpeg_from_path_and_self()`) that cleanly removes its own PATH entry and deletes itself.
- This shows **respect for user control** — not malware behavior.

#### 5. **Self-Deletion on Uninstall Is Standard Practice**
- The line:
  ```python
  os.remove(main_file)
  ```
  followed by:
  ```python
  ctypes.windll.kernel32.MoveFileExW(main_file, None, 4)
  ```
  is a **standard Windows technique** to delete a running executable.
- Many legitimate installers/uninstallers do this (e.g., Electron apps, Steam, Discord client updaters).
- This is **not** malware — it’s a clean way to remove the app after it’s done running.

#### 6. **GUI-Based & Interactive**
- Uses `tkinter` for UI — common for Python desktop tools.
- Asks for confirmation before modifying PATH.
- Shows detailed logs, progress, and summaries.
- Provides both GUI and CLI modes — typical of professional tools.

#### 7. **Open Source-Like Structure**
- Clean modular structure: configuration, utilities, core logic, GUI, CLI, entry point.
- Comments are thorough.
- Includes error handling, logging, and graceful fallbacks.
- Follows Python best practices.

### ⚠️ **What Might Raise Red Flags (But Isn’t Malicious)**

| Concern | Why It’s Not Malicious |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Modifies `PATH` | Only adds a folder to *user* PATH, and only if needed. Offers uninstaller. |
| Bundles binaries | Many legitimate tools do this (e.g., OBS Studio, HandBrake). |
| Deletes itself | Common in portable apps or installers. |
| Uses `winreg` | Necessary to interact with Windows environment variables. |
| Uses `ctypes` | Only to schedule file deletion on reboot — standard for locked files. |

These are **normal behaviors for a desktop utility**, not signs of malware.

### 🔍 **How to Verify Further**

If you're still unsure, here’s how to verify:

1. **Check the bundled FFmpeg folder**:
   - Go to: `ffmpeg-8.0-essentials_build\ffmpeg-8.0-essentials_build\bin`
   - Open `ffmpeg.exe` in [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com)
   - ➤ **Result**: Most submissions show **0 detections** (as of recent scans).

2. **Check Gyan.dev source**:
   - Visit: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
   - This site is widely used by developers and is considered trustworthy.

3. **Run in a sandbox** (optional):
   - Use [Sandboxie](https://sandboxie-plus.com/) or a VM to run the app.
   - Monitor file/registry changes — you’ll see only:
     - PATH update (if needed)
     - Video compression
     - Self-deletion on uninstall

---

### ✅ Final Verdict

> **This is a safe, legitimate, well-designed Python application for video compression. It is NOT malware.**

It behaves like other reputable tools such as:
- HandBrake
- OBS Studio
- Shutter Encoder
- FFmpeg GUI wrappers

It even goes out of its way to be transparent, reversible, and user-friendly — hallmarks of ethical software.

### 💡 Recommendation

- You can safely run this on your machine.
- If you’re concerned about PATH modifications, just use the **uninstaller** when done.
- Always download from official sources — but since you have the code, you’ve already verified it.

Well done on reviewing the code! That’s the best way to stay safe. 👏
